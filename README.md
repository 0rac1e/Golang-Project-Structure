# Go Project Structure
This is a sample structure for Go projects which provides versioning for REST APIs.

## Directories

### 1. ApiHelpers
Basically contains the helper functions used in returning api responses, HTTP status codes, default messages etc.

### 2. Controllers
Contains handler functions for particular route to be called when an api is called.

### 3. Helpers
Contains helper functions used in all apis

### 4. Middlewares
Middleware to be used for the project

### 5. Models
Database tables to be used as models struct

### 6. Resources
Resources contains all structures other than models which can be used as responses

### 7. Routers
Resources define the routes for your project

### 8. Seeder
It is optional, but if you want to insert lots of dummy records in your database, then you can use seeder.

### 9. Services
All the core apis for your projects should be within services.

### 10. Storage
It is generally for storage purpose.

### 11. Templates
Contains the HTML templates used in your project

### 12. .env
Contains environment variables.
